# Gekko Images

Some images of the Gekko processor from my microscope.

The technology of wiring is shown. IBM uses a very unusual way - the bends of the wires occur with smooth transitions (cascades). In addition, the unused portion of the top layer of metal is mostly covered with circular patterns (I call them "IBM pimples").

Of any markings, only one was found in the upper left corner. The inscriptions "IBM (C) 2000" and some other magic abbreviations (MQE, VQE, VLE, LMD). Perhaps a little higher there is another inscription, but it is hidden behind a layer of dirt (this is part of the microcircuit case).

Some areas are covered with "pimples".

Technological regions for checking the technical process of transistors. Here, most likely, simple transistors are left for diagnostics to make sure that the masks of the FET channels are applied correctly.

Another example of the used channel tracing technology from IBM. The one who developed the channel router algorithm is most likely a very smart person.

# Dolwin 0.15 Release Notes

In short, this release is a new, completely rewritten DSP core.

The release work was evenly spread over previous releases, but the bulk of the new DSP core was implemented in this version.

As you can see, there are some problems with the picture quality, that is, there is still work to be done for the next releases.

Enjoy :)

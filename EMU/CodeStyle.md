# CodeStyle

In modern development environments, you don't have to think about this too much, but here are a few recommendations (they are not required, but desirable if possible).

## Basic data types

Use the c++ standard stdint.h header.

## Tabs

Use tabs.

If you still like spaces more and want to fix someone else's source with tabs (or vice versa), do not mix.

## Comments

```c++
// Single line comments are preferable
```

If you like `/* ... */` more, then you do not need to correct all comments like `//`, but it is better to stick to one style (do not mix).

## Indentation

Example:

```c++

bool foo(int a, int b)
{
	if (a == b)
	{
		return true;
	}

	return false;
}

```

## Description of methods

Use Doxygen supported rules.

Example 1:

```c++
/// @brief Get parameters section
/// @param[in] parent Parent resource
/// @param[out] paramOut Where will the parameter value pointer return
/// @return (int) Error code
/// @retval -1 Missing options section
```

Example 2 (autogenerated by Visual Studio):

```c++

Press `/` three times.

```

## Sectioning

Try not to use:

```c++
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Better:

```c++

#pragma region "Section name and description"

#pragma endregion "Section name and description"

```

## Case

Use `CamelCase` for class and method names. For property names use `snake_case` or `lowCamelCase`.

## #define

Avoid using macro-programming. Even if you really want to make 100 methods that are slightly different from each other with a single macro - it's better to make 100 copypastes.

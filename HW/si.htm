This register is double buffered, so main processor writes to the 
SIC0OUTBUF will not interfere with the serial interface output 
transfer. Internally, a second buffer is used to hold the output data to be 
transferred across the serial interface. To check if SIC0OUTBUF 
has been transferred to the second buffer, main processor polls the 
SISR[WRST0] register. When SICOOUTBUF is transferred, SISR[WRST0] is cleared. <br><br>

    Bits   Mnemonic   Type  Reset Description
     31     ERRSTAT     R   0     Error Status: This bit represents the current error status
                                  for the last SI polling transfer on channel 0. This
                                  register is updated after each polling transfer on this channel.
                                  0 = No error on last transfer
                                  1 = Error on last transfer
     30    ERRLATCH     R   0     Error Latch: This bit is an error status summary of the
                                  SISR error bits for this channel. If an error has
                                  occurred on a past SI transfer on channel 0 (polling or
                                  Com transfer), this bit will be set. To determine the
                                  exact error, read the SISR register. This bit is actually
                                  an `or` of the latched error status bits for channel 0 in
                                  the SISR. The bit is cleared by clearing the appropriate
                                  error status bits latched in the SISR. The no response
                                  error indicates that a controller is not present on this channel.
                                  0 = No errors latched
                                  1 = Error latched. Check SISR.
    29:24   INPUT0      R         Input Byte 0: This is the first data byte of the response
                                  packet sent from the game controller to the SI I/F for
                                  channel 0. The top two bits of the byte returning from
                                  the controller are assumed to be `0`, so they are not
                                  included.
    23:16   INPUT1      R         Input Byte 1: This is the second data byte of the
                                  response packet sent from the game controller to the SI
                                  I/F for channel 0.
    15:8    INPUT2      R         Input Byte 2: This is the third data byte of the response
                                  packet sent from the game controllers to the SI I/F for
                                  channel 0.
     7:0    INPUT3      R         Input Byte 3: This is the fourth data byte of the
                                  response packet sent from the game controller to the SI
                                  I/F for channel 0.

SIC0INBUFH and SIC0INBUFL are double buffered to prevent 
inconsistent data reads due to main processor conflicting with incoming 
<B><I>serial</I></B> interface data. To insure data read from SIC0INBUFH and 
SIC0INFUBL are consistent, a locking mechanism prevents the double buffer from 
copying new data to these registers. Once SIC0INBUFH is read, both SIC0INBUFH 
and SIC0INBUFL are `locked` until SIC0INBUFL is read. While the buffers are 
`locked`, new data is not copied into the buffers. When SIC0INBUFL is read, the 
buffers become unlocked again. <BR><BR>SIC0INBUF SI Channel 0 Input Buffer Low

The software should not modify any of the transfer parameters (OUTLNGTH, 
INLNGTH, CHANNEL) until the current transfer is complete. This is done to 
prevent a SICOM transfer already in progress from being disturbed. When writing

</PRE><BR><BR>FIG. 8D is an even more detailed overall view of 
<B><I>serial</I></B> interface 1000 showing the details of <B><I>serial</I></B> 
interface communication circuitry and registers 1012. Controllers 52a and 52b 
(and 52c and 52d, if present) are connected to game console 54 via connector 
ports 1002. Modem 1404 modulates and demodulates data transferred between the 
controllers and the console. In the example system, communication between the 
console and the controllers uses duty-cycle (pulse-width) modulation and the 
data is communicated over one line. The communication is half-duplex. The byte 
transfer order is "big-endian" in which within a given multi-byte numeric 
representation, the most significant byte has the lowest address (i.e., the data 
is transferred "big-end" first). Controller input/output buffer 1016 is used for 
normal data transfers involving controllers 52a-52d. As shown in FIG. 8D, 
input/output buffer 1016 is arranged as a double buffer. Communication RAM 1014 
is provided for use in variable-size data transfers to and from controllers 
52a-52d. In the example system, the maximum data size of these variable-size 
data transfers is 32 words. Of course, the present invention is not limited in 
this respect. Channel selector circuit 1408 controls selectors 1412a-1412d to 
selectively connect modem 1404 to either communication RAM 1014 or input/output 
buffer 1016. An HV counter latch circuit 1406 latches the screen position of a 
flash signal when a trigger input is received from a light gun unit. In the 
example system shown in FIG. 8, triggers inputs to the HV counter latch circuit 
1406 are provided for connectors 1 and 2 only. It will be apparent that trigger 
inputs may be provided for the other connectors if desired. HV counter latch 
circuit 1406 may also be used with light pens connected to connectors 1 and/or 
2. <BR><BR>Additional details of the <B><I>serial</I></B> interface may be found

    All registers are 16-bit only. All bits are in little-endian format 
    (mask for bit 0 is 0x0001).

CP_SR - Command Processor Status Register [CC000000] R
    bit 0 : fifo overflow (wrptr > hiWatermark)
    bit 1 : fifo underlow (rdptr > loWatermark)
    bit 2 : GP is idle for reading (1 : idle)
    bit 3 : GP is idle for commands (1 : idle)
    bit 4 : breakpoint interrupt
    (other bits are reserved)

CP_CR - Command Processor Control Register [CC000002] R/W
    bit 0 : enable reading of fifo by GP
    bit 1 : write 1, to clear breakpoint interrupt ?
    bit 2 : enable overflow checks (high watermark)
    bit 3 : enable underlow checks (low watermark)
    bit 4 : link GP and CPU fifos
    bit 5 : enable breakpoint checks ?
    (other bits are reserved)

CP_CLR - Command Processor Clear Register [CC000004] W
    bit 0 : write 1, to clear fifo overflow
    bit 1 : write 1, to clear fifo underlow
    (other bits are reserved)

Exploring of Gekko Special Purpose Registers.

Version 1.0. (22 Sep 2006)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPR 0
-----

"mtspr/mfspr is supervisor-only if SPR[0] = 1" as written in PPC manual.
Set program exception handler.
In supervisor mode:
Read SPR[0]: Program Exception (Illegal)
Write SPR[0] 0x00000001: Program Exception (Illegal)
Write SPR[0] 0x00000000: Program Exception (Illegal)
Set MSR[PR] to 1 (user mode)
Read SPR[0]: Program Exception (Illegal)
Write SPR[0]: Program Exception (Illegal)

XER (1)
-------

Write 0xFFFFFFFF to XER.
Result: 0xE000FF7F.
Second write 0x00000000.
Result: 0x00000000.
Bits 16-23 are R/W and probably have some meaning on other PPC models.
Bits 3-15, 24 are Read 0 only.
Same for OEA.

SPR 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
--------------------

OEA and UISA Read or Write: Program Exception (Illegal).

LR (8)
------

All bits are valid R/W without any doubts. :)
Prove:
        mfspr   r31, LR
        li      r30, 0xFFFF     # LR = 0xFFFFFFFF
        mtspr   LR, r30
        mfspr   r30, LR
        mtspr   LR, r31
        mr      r3, r30
        bl      PrintValue
Output: 0xFFFFFFFF
Same for OEA.

other registers work the same, because otherwise PPC UNIX-based software
never existed :)

in WIMG bit-field is allowed (but speciefed by architecture as boundedly-undefined).

<center><h3>The GameCube CPU </h3></center>
<p>While the Xbox was a PC turned game-console, Nintendo's GameCube was designed 
  as a game console from the ground up. Nintendo's needs for this next-generation 
  console were very clear: the chip would have to be powerful, cheap to manufacture, 
  and run cool enough that it could fit in a very small enclosure. Nintendo ended 
  up contracting IBM to handle the production of the CPUs for the GameCube based 
  on their well-known PowerPC 750CXe processor.</p>
<p>However details on this processor are sketchy at best but the information we've 
  been able to gather points at a relatively unmodified PowerPC 750CXe microprocessor 
  with the addition of close to 40 new instructions (potentially SIMD FP) designed 
  to specifically aid in game performance. Followers of the PowerPC architecture 
  will quickly realize that these additional instructions do not comprise all 
  of the instructions provided by Motorola's AltiVec SIMD instruction set. It 
  is possible that only a subset of AltiVec was implemented into this processor, 
  using instructions heavily geared towards the tasks that it would be handling.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="gekko.jpg" width="400" height="328"></p>
<p>The basics of this PPC 750CXe derivative (codenamed Gekko) are fairly simple; 
  the PowerPC core features a 4-stage basic integer pipeline which is mostly responsible 
  for the very low clock speeds the core is able to achieve. Most important for 
  gaming performance however are more precise floating point calculations and 
  the Gekko's floating point pipeline is 7 stages long. Since the Gekko is a native 
  RISC processor it does not suffer the same fate as its Xbox counterpart in that 
  it doesn't have to spend much time in the fetch/decoding stages of the pipeline. 
  Immediately upon fetching the RISC instructions to be executed, they are dispatched 
  and one clock cycle later, they are ready to be sent to the execution units.</p>
<p>The PowerPC architecture is a 64-bit architecture with a 32-bit subset which 
  in the case of the Gekko processor, is what is used. The CPU supports 32-bit 
  addresses and features two 32-bit Integer ALUs; separate to that is a 64-bit 
  FPU that is capable of working on either 64-bit floats or two 32-bit floats 
  using its thirty two 64-bit FP registers. This abundance of operating registers 
  is mirrored in the 32 General Purpose Registers (GPRs) that the processor has, 
  dwarfing the Xbox's x86-limited offering (8 GPRs).</p>
<p>Although both the Gekko and the Intel CPU used in the Xbox are built upon advanced 
  0.18-micron processes, the Gekko is held back by its relatively short pipeline 
  limiting it to generally no higher than 500MHz. The Gekko does use Copper interconnects 
  which are superior to their Aluminum counterparts (used in the Xbox CPU for 
  example) in that they more efficiently conduct electricity, but this advantage 
  is still not able to result in a higher clock speed for the CPU. In the case 
  of the GameCube, the CPU is clocked at 485MHz, or 3 times its 162MHz FSB frequency. 
  The benefit of a shorter pipeline is of course, an increased number of instructions 
  that can be processed in those limited number of clocks. However from all of 
  that data that we have seen comparing the PowerPC 750 to even the desktop Intel 
  Celeron processor, it does not seem that the Gekko can compete, performance-wise. 
</p>
<p>Your experience in the PC hardware world however should have taught you that 
  CPU performance does not matter when it comes to games as long as you are bottlenecked 
  elsewhere in the system, so theoretically Gekko could be more than enough for 
  the GameCube but we have a feeling it's not. </p>
<p>Instead of being a processing powerhouse, Gekko was actually chosen for its 
  physical characteristics. Although it does have a larger on-die L1 &amp; L2 
  cache than the Xbox CPU (64KB/256KB vs. 32KB/128KB) and is composed of more 
  transistors (over 21 million vs. approximately 9 million for the Xbox CPU), 
  Gekko's die is under 45 mm^2. For comparison, the processor used in the Xbox 
  has a die measuring approximately 100 mm^2. </p>
<p>The Gekko is actually a very cool running CPU, dissipating around 5W at its 
  485MHz operating frequency. Again, when compared to the Intel CPU used in the 
  Xbox, you're looking at roughly three times more being produced by the X-CPU 
  than by the GameCube's Gekko. </p>
<p>So while isn't as powerful at the Xbox CPU, Gekko's smaller die and cooler 
  operation provide for lower manufacturing costs and a smaller sized console 
  which fit Nintendo's goals perfectly.</p>
<p>Gekko does have more FSB bandwidth at its disposal than the X-CPU, simply because 
  its FSB is running at 162MHz vs. the 133MHz FSB frequency that is within the 
  limits of Intel's AGTL+ spec. This results in a 1.3GB/s connection between Gekko 
  and the North Bridge, which like in the case of the Xbox's nForce-based platform, 
  is integrated into a single chip along with the graphics core.</p>
<p>It's time to meet a close friend of Gekko; we call him Flipper.</p>
